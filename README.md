# BasicPortfolioo

## Description

   This application is made with HTML and CSS to make a portfolio sample. It has three pages index.html, contact.html and portfolio.html.  

The main concepts in css used here are:
* Float: The float property specifies how an element should float.
* Padding: Padding creates extra space within an element.
* Margin: The margin property sets the margins for an element.
* Display: The display property specifies the display behavior (the type of rendering box) of an element.
* Overflow: The overflow property specifies what should happen if content overflows an element's box.
